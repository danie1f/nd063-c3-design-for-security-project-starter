The application balance and web application instance should be running on HTTPS and port 443

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

No. Any user or services within the same VPC will still be able to access the S3 Bucket.

No, applying default encryption will only be applied to new uploads.

If the origial cloud formation templates are applied, then the changes that I have made will be reset to the configuration on the templates. The cloudfront templates would need to be updated to remediate any security issues.
